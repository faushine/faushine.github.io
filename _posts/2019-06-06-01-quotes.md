## Quotes in bash (see 'man bash')

- backticks, single back quotes->executes command

```bash
ls -al use $(ls -al) instead
```

- double quotes '' not ""

    ```bash
    $ -usually port of retrieving var.data
    ' -single quotes
    \ -backsbash, usually used to force shell to treat characters
    *, @, # -are special, will see shortly  
    ```

- single quote(') 
  -> no substitution at all
  
  -> cannot be nested eg |||

- egrep - extended global regular expression print 
  ->line-by-line comparisons an input and print

- regular expression and characters plus meta/special characters that control what matches

    ```bash
    | -> alternations i.e egrep dog|cat myfile.txt
    () -> used to group string
    * -> 0 or more of preceding character eg ba* => b, ba, baaa, or xb, xby
    + -> 1 or more ....
    [] -> select *one* of eg. [abcd] => [a-z0-9A-Z]
    => [^a-d] not abcd
    ^xgg -> line must start with xgg
    xgg$ -> line must end with xgg
    ^xgg$ -> entire line must be xgg
    ```

### Examples:

Find all occurrences of 'cs246' in f.txt

```bash
egrep cs246 f.txt
```

Find all occurrences of either 'cs246' of 'cs247'

``` bash
egrep cs246|cs247 < f.txt
or 
egrep cs24[67] f.txt
```

Find all lines whose length is even  eg.0 character or 2,4 etc

```bash
egrep "^(..)*$" f.txt
```

All filenames in current directory, which contain only 1 'a' (but can have other characters)

```bash
ls | egrep "^[^a]*a[^a]*$"
```

Find all 5-letter words that start with 'e'

```bash
egrep "^e.....$" < /usr/share/dict/words
```

- globbing patterns is not regular expression 

    ```bash
    a?=>0 or 1 a 
    ? [x] man 7 glob
    * [!x]

    ls -l
    - rwx rwx rwx
    owner(user) group other(no r or w there)
    chmod: change permissions
    -R recursive change

    who +(-) what 
    ugo      rwx
    eg: chmod -R o-rwx
    ```
