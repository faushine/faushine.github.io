# I/O

~/cs246/1195/lecture/c++/Q2-io

readInts.cc

- #include <iostream> to access cin/cout/cerr
(actual c++ objects; equivalent to stdin, stdout, stderr respectively)

    &rarr; part of "std" namespace, so either need "std:" in front of cin, etc, or need "using namespace std;"

- endl: combination of newline + request to flush buffer
  
- c++ over-loads bit-shift operators for I/O

    ```bash
    std::istream operator <<(istream&, int&)
    int i,j; char c;
    cin >>i>>c>>j;
    ```

- must try to read before check for success

now, if have a non-int "throw" away offending character(s) and keep going

&rarr; use cin.ignore() to throw away 1 char and must reset state bits via cin.clear()

conversionChar.cc

- must include \<iomanip>
- format made (hex, octal, dex) remain until set to something else
- setw(3) ->set width i.e. pads values(default in space)

## C - style strings(char*, char[])

- must explicitly manage memory i.e. reallocate + copy if need larger
- must delimit with '\'; easy error if forget or in wrong place

## C++ - style strings

```bash
#include<string>
std::string s = "hello"
```

- overloaded operator for string concatenation?
getline(cin,s)

sstream

istreamstring

ostreamstring

mostly to build up strings for a output.
