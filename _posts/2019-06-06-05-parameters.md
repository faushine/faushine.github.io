# Default parameters

- lets you avoid code repetition by using 'overloading'.
- C doesn't allow overloading since all function names must be unique, but C++ allows this:
  
  ```c++
  void print(int c); 
  void print(char c); 
  void print(double c);
  ```

- but in order to for the compiler to know which one you meant, the functions must differ in number and/or types the parameters.
  
  ```c++
  print('a'); 
  print(5);
  ```

- note that it isn't enough to just have different them return types as a way to distinguish between them
- when have default arguments, they must be the last arguments in the list, no gaps.
- c++ allows "structs" like c, but embed functions(called 'methods') within the struct.

# Constants

```c++
const int MAX_SIZE = 4026
```

- compiler will let you know if try to modify constants

- can declare return type, parameters and/or methods as "const"

    ```c++
    struct Node{
        void printList() const{
            Node *p = next;
            while(p!=nullptr){
                cout<<p->next<<endl;
                p = p->next;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

# Parameter Passing

- call-by-value: parameters and/or return values are copied on the runtime stack

    ```c++
    int x = 1;
    foo(x);
    cout<< x;

    void foo(int i){
        i+=1;
    }
    ```

&rarr; value won't be changed since changes are discarded

&rarr; if size of int (or less), or making copy anyways, should't use!

- could use pointers, but then have to deference

    ```c++
    int x = 1;
    foo(x);
    cout<< x << endl;
    void foo(int *i){
        *i+=1;
    }
    ```
  
    ```c++
    int x = 1;
    foo(x);
    coit << x;
    void foo(int &(i)){
        i+=1;
    }
    ```
