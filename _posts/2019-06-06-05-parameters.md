# Default parameters

- lets you avoid code repetition by using 'overloading'
- C doesn't allow overloading since all function names must be unique, but C++ allows this: void print(int c); void print(char c); void print(double c)
but in order to for the compiler to know which one you meant, the functions must differ in number and/or types the parameters eg.print('a'); print(5);
- note that it isn't enough to just have different them return types as a way to distinguish between them
- when have default arguments, they must be the last arguments in the list, no gaps.
- c++ allows "structs" like c, but embed functions(called 'methods') within the struct

# Constants

```c++
const int MAX_SIZE = 4026
```

- compiler will let you know if try to modify constants

- can declare return type, parameters and/or methods as "const"

```c++
struct Node{
    void printList() const{
        Node *p = next;
        while(p!=nullptr){
            cout<<p->next<<endl;
            p = p->next;
        }
    }
}
```

# Parameter Passing

- call-by-value: parameters and/or return values are copied on the runtime stack

```c++
int x = 1;
foo(x);
cout<< x;

void foo(int i){
    i+=1;
}
```

=> value won't be changed since changes are discarded

=> if size of int (or less), or making copy anyways, should't use!

- could use pointers, but then have to deference

```c++
int x = 1;
foo(x);
cout<< x << endl;
void foo(int *i){
    *i+=1;
}
```

- a herrative is "pass by reference", equivalent to constant pointer, but automatically dereferenced
  
```c++
int x = 1;
foo(x);
coit << x;
void foo(int &(i)){
    i+=1;
}
