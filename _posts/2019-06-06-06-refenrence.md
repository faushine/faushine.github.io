# Reference

Things you cannot do with references: eg int i; int $reg=i; (lvalue)

1. cannot bind "ref" to another memory location

    lvalue: whatever (usually) has a memory location; if it's not an lvalue, it's a rvalue

2. cannot bind it to an rvalue eg.

```c++
int &ref=3;
int &ref=xyz;
//however, this is correct. l has a memory address
int &ref = l; //ref是别名
```

- can have a reference to a pointer, not a pointer to a reference

```c++
int *ptr;
int *&ref = ptr; //leagal
int &*ref; //won't complie
int &&ref; // not a reference to a reference means something else in c++11
```

- passing by reference avoids copying done by pass-by values; but, function anc now change it
  
  -> declare it as constant eg. 

  ```c++
  void foo(const & int i){
      //
  }  
  ```

  return by value, pointer, or reference

- in some circumstances, no choice eg. istream operator>> has to return stream by reference in order to be able to cascade operators eg. cin>>i>>y

eg.

```c++
// overloading
std::ostream & operator<<(std::ostream &out const Node &n){
    out << n.value << endl;
    return out;
}

Node n{3, null};
cout << n;
```

```c++
Node getNode(){
    Node n{3, nullptr};
    return n;
    // makes copy of local Node "n"(lvalue) on runtime stack(rvalue)
}
//...
Node m = getNode(); // rvalue copied into m
```

- but smart compilers, or c++11; can optimize this and/or use "move"

semantics = > actually move efficient than might expect

```c++
Node * getNode(){
    Node n;
    return &n;
}
//...
Node * ptr = getNode();
//has address of variable that no longer exists

Node * getNode(){
    Node n;
   return new Node{3, nullptr};
   //now need to remember to do a delete
}
//...
Node * ptr = getNode();

Node & getNode(){
    Node n;
   return *(new Node{3, nullptr}); 
   //now need to remember to do a delete
}
//...
Node & ptr = getNode();
// delete &ptr;
```

## Dynamic memory allocation

**c**: use malloc, calloc, realloc, free

=> use (void*), so no type safe and easier to make mistakes

**c++**: uses new, delete, nullptr

```c
int * ptr = nullptr;
ptr = new int {-13};
delete ptr;
```

```c++
int ** arr;
arr = new int * [max];
for (int i=0; i< max; ++i){
    arr[i] = new int [dimx];
    //...
}
//...
for (int i = 0; i < max; i++){
    delete [] arr[i];
    delete [] arr;
}
```

- program crashes if try to free same memory address more than one

## operator overloading

see operators/grades.cc,vectors.cc

## preprocessor 

- first compilation phase (see g++ -E)

- translates "directives" : #\<keywords>
  eg. #include\<iostream>

```c++
#define MAX 10 //use const int MAX=10; instead since not type safe
MAXabc = MAXy;
cout << "MAXxxx";

#define SECURITY_LEVEL 1
#if SECURITY_LEVEL == 1
#elif SECURITY_LEVEL == 2
#elif
#endif
```
