# Separate compilation

Recall: 
- declaration: specifies existence eg.type
  
  ```c++
  struct Node;
  void print(std::ostream &out, const Node &n);
  extern int MAX;
  ```

- definition: variables(and functions) have space allocated; fll type info is known
  
  ```c++
  eg. struct nODE {
      int value;
      Node *next;
  }
  ```

```c++
void print(std::ostream &out, const node &n){
    out<<'('<< n.value << "," << hex << n.next<<')';
}
int MAX=10;
```

## module: collection of data, types, functions

ideally serves one main purpose (Single Responsibility Principle)

- a module is made up of:

    - interfaces (*.h, *.hpp) contain type definitions (maybe declarations, but eventually need defn) global variable and function declarations

    - implementations(*.cpp, *.cc) contains function definitions and global variable definitions

- by using "separate compilation, only recompile what you have to and "link" the pieces

- separate compilation implicts using the "-c" flag when compiling an implementaion file (.cc) to create the corresponding object file (.o) and then linking all .o files together to create the executable.

-> recompile only what changed, then relink everything.

- in order to automate this, need to find a way to figure out dependencies and what changed

## make

- by default, make looks for a file called "makefile" or "Makefile"

- the file lists all dependencies, and what command (or commands) to run

```bash
<target> : <dependencies>
    \t command 1
    \t command 2
clean:
    rm *.o a.out

make clean
```

- vec-example 2

CXX <- makes's variable to definde c++ compilier

CXXFLAGS <- makes var for compilier options

make knows how to create a .o file from a .cc without you specifying, -> but still listing dependencies

stop comp

- can't have multiple definitions (see exanple 3)

- use "include guards" to prevent this

```c++
#ifndef <randomname>
#define <randomname>
...
#endif

#ifndef VEC_H
#define VEC_H
...
#endif
```
