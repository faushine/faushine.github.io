## Separate compilation do's and don'ts

1) always put include guards in your header files
2) Never put "using namespace std;" in your headerfiles (use "std::istream",etc)
3) Never compile a header file
4) Never include implementation files

# Classes

```c++
#ifndef STUDENT_H
#define student.h
struct Student{
    int assns, midterm, final;
    int grade();
}
#endif
```

```c++
#include "student.h"
int student::grade(){
    return (assns*0.4 + midterm*0.2 + final*0.4)
}
```

```c++
//main.cc
#include "student.h"
int main(){
    Student s{75,80,77};
};
int final grade = s.grade();
```

- C++ has a "this" keyword, which is a pointer and helps the object refer to itself when needed.

```c++
struct student{
    ...
    void student(){
        this->mt = mt;
    }
    int grade(){
        return (this.assns);
    }
}
```

## Initializing objects

can initialize an object using either = or ()

```c++
Student s(24,24,24);
Student t = s; // t has same value as s
Student r = Student {54,45,45};
```

- but, there are complicated rules as to where and when they can't be used, so c++11 introduced "uniform initialization"

- always use {} in this course

>
    Aside: see "zero initialization" for what c++11 and up will set to 0(or zero-equipment)


- use "**constructors**" (**ctor**) to ensure objects are initialize "properly"

```c++
struct Student{
    ...
    Student(int a=0, int m = 0, int f = 0);
};
student::Student(int a, int m, int f){
    assns = a;
    mt = m;
    final = f;
}
```

- a "default ctor" is a ctor with no parameters
    - the compiler gives you one, which follows basic initialization rules, until you write a ctor.
    - see, "zero initialization"
    - objects must have a default ctor, else error
    ```c++
    struct Class{
        Student arr[180];
        ...
    };
    ```

- what if want a constant?

```c++
Struct Student{
    const int MAX_GRADE = 100;
    ...
}
```

Q: what if want student to have a different, constant id# for each student object?

A: There are 3 steps when an object is created:

1. allocate space
2. initialize fields
3. ctor body runs

- initializing them in the ctor body is too late 

    => needs to be done as part of step 2
    
    => introduce idea of Memory Initialization Lists(MIL)

    - special syntax on ctor definition

    ```c++
    Student(const int id, int a = 0, int m = 0, int f = 0):id{id}, assns{a}, int {m}, final{f}{
        /* nothing left to do */
    };
    ```

- must use MIL if object has data field that are objects that don't have default ctors
    
    => use MIL as much as possible since can prevent duplicate work. i.e.initialize in both MIL and in ctor body.

    ```
    struct Student{
        Grade a,m,f; // Grade(int i = 0)
        ...
        Student(Grade a, Grade m, Grade f): 
        this->a=a; this->m=m; this->f=f; 
    }
    ```
